// running this app will first display all the items available
	// this will include ids, names, and prices for each
// then prompt the user with two messages
	// first message asks the id of the product they would like to buy
	// second message asks how many of this item they would like to buy
// once the customer has placed the order, app should check if the store has enough of the product in stock to fill the order.
	// if not, the app should alert the customer and stop the order
	// if there is enough, fulfill the order
		// this means updating SQL database to reflect quality
		// once the order goes through, show customer the total cost of their purchase
